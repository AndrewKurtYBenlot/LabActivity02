			<li>The most suited role for me in volleyball is the Opposite Hitter.</li>
			<li>The Opposite Hitter is so cool because it substitutes the other hitters when they're not open.</li>
			<li>My favorite opposite hitter is Yuji Nishida. He was nicknamed "Nishida Airlines" because he jumped so high.</li>
